            <p>A frontend developer who geeks out over clean code, intuitive design, and the magic of turning ideas
                into
                real, working things. Web apps? Love ‘em. Websites? Can’t get enough. Give me a problem to solve or
                a
                concept to build, and I’ll happily lose track of time making it happen.</p>
            <p>
                By day, I’m crafting full-stack solutions, balancing frontend flair with backend logic (Angular,
                React, Spring Boot, etc.) By night, I’m either deep-diving into some new tech rabbit hole or producing
                electronic music—because creativity shouldn’t stop at the keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m all about that "aha" moment. Whether it’s nailing a tricky feature, designing an interface that
                just
                clicks, or stumbling on the perfect synth riff.
            </p>
